## 테스팅 & 프로파일링

### 테스팅

#### 기본 유닛 테스트

All of our tests must have the format `<filename>_test.go`. Otherwise, the testing tool is not gonna find the tests. Test files are not compiled into our final binary. Test files should be in the same package as your code. We might also want to have afolder called test for more than unit test, say integration test. The package name can be the name only or name_test.

모든 테스트 파일은 `<filename>_test.go` 형식을 맞추어야 한다. 형식이 맞지 않으면 테스팅 도구가 테스트를 찾지 못한다. 테스트 파일들은 최종 실행 파일로 컴파일 되지 않는다. 테스트 파일들은 코드와 같은 패키지 상에 있어야 한다. 통합 테스트 같이 단위 테스트 이상을 진행시 test라는 폴더가 필요할 수 있다.

If we go with name_test, it allows us to make sure these tests work with the package. The only reason that we don't want to do this is when we have a function or method that is unexported.

name_test를 사용하면, 패키지 단위로 테스트할 수 있도록 해준다. 내보내지 않는 함수나 메서드가 있을 때만 이 방법을 사용하지 않는다.

However, if we don't use name_test, it will raise a red flag because if we cannot test the exported API to get the coverage for the unexported API then we know we are missing something. Therefore, 9/10 this is what we want.

하지만,[재방문] 우리가 name_test를 사용하지 않는다면, 내보내지 않은 API에 대한 커버리지를 얻기 위해 내보낸 API를 테스트할 수 없어 빨간 깃발이 출력될 것이다. 따라서, 9/10이 우리가 원하는 결과이다.

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "testing" // This is Go testing package.
)
```

These constants give us checkboxes for visualization.

이 상수들은 시각화를 위한 확인란을 제공할 것이다.

```go
const (
    succeed = "\u2713"
    failed = "\u2717"
)
```

TestBasic validates the http.Get function can download content. Every test will be associated with the test function. It starts with the word Test and the first word after Test must be capitalized. It uses a testing.T pointer as its parameter. When writing test, we want to focus on usability first. We must write it the same way as we would write it in production. We also want the verbosity of tests so we are 3 different methods of t: Log or Log f, Fatal or Fatal f, Error or Error f. That is the core APIs for testing.

`TestBasic`은 `http.Get` 함수가 콘텐츠를 다운로드할 수 있는지 확인한다. 모든 테스트는 테스트 함수와 같이 작동한다. 테스트 함수는 Test라는 단어로 시작하고 Test 다음의 첫번째 단어는 대문자이여야 한다. 본 함수는 testing.T 포인터를 매개변수로 사용한다. 테스트를 작성할 때에는 사용성에 중점을 두어야 한다. 제품화 단계와 동일한 방식으로 테스트를 작성해야 한다. 또한 테스트는 3가지의 다른 정도로 출력할 수 있는데: Log 혹은 Log f, Fatal 혹은 Fata f, Error 혹은 Error f의 방법이 있다. 이것이 테스트를 위한 핵심 API이다.

Log: Write documentation out into the log output.

Error: Write documentation and also say that this test is failed but we are continuing moving forward to execute code in this test

Fatal: Similarly, document that this test is failed but we are done. We move on to the next test function.

**Given, When, Should format.**

Given: Why are we writing this test?

When: What data are we using for this test?

Should: When are we expected to see it happen or not happen?

We are also using the artificial block between a long Log function. They help with readability.

```go
func TestBasic(t *testing.T) {
    url := "https://www.google.com/"
    statusCode := 200

    t.Log("Given the need to test downloading content.")
    {
        t.Logf("\tTest 0:\tWhen checking %q for status code %d", url, statusCode)
        {
            resp, err := http.Get(url)
            if err != nil {
                t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call : %v", failed, err)
            }
            t.Logf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call.", succeed)

            defer resp.Body.Close()

            if resp.StatusCode == statusCode {
                t.Logf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code.", succeed, statusCode)
            } else {
                t.Errorf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code : %d", failed, statusCode, resp.StatusCode)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We can just say "go test" and the testing tool will find that function. We can also say "go test -v" for verbosity, we will get a full output of the logging. Suppose that we have a lot of test functions, "go test -run TestBasic" will only run the TestBasic function.

```text

    basic_test.go:71:   ✓      Should receive a 200 status code.
PASS

```

##### Table Test

Set up a data structure of input to expected output. This way we don't need a separate function for each one of these. We just have 1 test function. As we go along, we just add more to the table.

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "testing"
)
```

TestTable validates the http Get function can download content and handles different status conditions properly

```go
func TestTable(t *testing.T) {
```

This table is a slice of anonymous struct type. It is the URL we are gonna call and statusCode is what we expect.

```go
    tests := []struct {
        url         string
        statusCode  int
    }{
        {"https://www.google.com", http.StatusOK},
        {"http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstorie.rss", http:StatusNotFound},
    }

    t.Log("Given the need to test downloading different content.")
    {
        for i, tt := ragne tests {
            t.Logf("\tTest: %d\tWhen checking %q for status code %d", i, tt.url, tt.statusCode)
            {
                resp, err := http.Get(tt.url)
                if err != nil{
                    t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call : %v", failed, err)
                }
                t.Logf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call.", succeed)

                defer resp.Body.Close()

                if resp.StatusCode == tt.statusCode {
                    t.Logf("\t%s\tSould receive a %d status code.", succeed, tt.statusCode)
                } else {
                    t.Errorf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code : %v", failed, tt.statusCode, resp.StatusCode)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```text
=== RUN TestTable
--- PASS: TestTable (0.31s)

    table_test.go:49:   ✓      Should receive a 404 status code.
PASS
ok      command-line-arguments 0.472s
```

##### Sub Test

Sub test helps us streamline our test functions, filters out command-line level big tests into smaller sub tests.

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "testing"
)
```

TestSub validates the http Get function can download content and handles different status conditions properly.

```go
func TestSub(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name string
        url string
        statusCode int
    }{
        {"statusok", "https://www.google.com/", http.StatusOK},
        {"statusnotfound", "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstorie.rss", http.StatusNotFound},
    }
    t.Log("Given the need to test downloading different content.")
    {
```

Range over our table but this time, create an anonymous function that takes a testing T parameter. This is a test function inside a test function. What's nice about it is that we are gonna have a new function for each set of data that we have in our table. Therefore, we will end up with 2 different functions here.

```go
        for i, tt := range tests {
            tf := func(t *testing.T) {
                t.Logf("\tTest: %d\tWhen checking %q for status code %d", i, tt.url, tt.statusCode)
                {
                    resp, err := http.Get(tt.url)
                    if err != nil {
                        t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call : %v", failed, err)
                    }
                    t.Logf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call.", succeed)

                    defer resp.Body.Close()

                    if resp.StatusCode == tt.statusCode {
                        t.Logf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code.", succeed, tt.statusCode)
                    } else {
                        t.Errorf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code : %v", failed, tt.statusCode, resp.StatusCode)
                    }
                }
            }
```

Once we declare this function, we tell the testing tool to register it as a sub test under the test name.

```go
            t.Run(tt.name, tf)
        }
    }
}
```

TestParallelize validates the http Get function can download content and handles different status conditions properly but runs the tests in parallel.

```go
func TestParallelize(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name string
        url string
        statusCode int
    }{
        {"statusok", "https://www.goinggo.net/post/index.xml", http.StatusOK},
        {"statusnotfound", "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstorie.rss", http.StatusNotFound},
    }

    t.Log("Given the need to test downloading different content.")
    {
        for i, tt := range tests {
            tf := func(t *testing.T) {
```

The only difference here is that we call Parallel function inside each of these individual sub test functions.

```go
                t.Parallel()

                t.Logf("\tTest: %d\tWhen checking %q for status code %d", i, tt.url, tt.statusCode)
                {
                    resp, err := http.Get(tt.url)
                    if err != nil {
                        t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call : %v", failed, err)
                    }
                    t.Logf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call.", succeed)

                    defer resp.Body.Close()

                    if resp.StatusCode == tt.statusCode {
                        t.Logf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code.", succeed, tt.statusCode)
                    } else {
                        t.Errorf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code : %v", failed, tt.statusCode, resp.StatusCode)
                    }
                }
            }

            t.Run(tt.name, tf)
        }
    }
}
```

Because we have sub tests, we can run the following to separate them:
"go test -run TestSub -v"
"go test -run TestSub/statusok -v"
"go test -run TestSub/statusnotfound -v"
"go test -run TestParallelize -v"

##### Web Server

###### Web Server

If we write our own web server, we would like to test it as well without manually having to stand up a server. The Go standard library also supports this.

Below is our simple web server.

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
```

Import handler package that has a set of routes that we are gonna work with.

```go
    "github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go/go/testing/web_server/handlers"
)

func main() {
    handlers.Routes()

    log.Println("listener : Started : Listening on: http://localhost:4000")
    http.ListenAndServe(":4000", nil)
}

```

###### Handlers

Package handlers provides the endpoints for the web service.

```go
package handlers

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "net/http"
)
```

Routes sets the routes for the web service. It has 1 route call `/sendjson`. When that route is executed, it wil lcall the SendJSON function

```go
func Routes() {
    http.HandleFunc("/sendjson", SendJSON)
}
```

SendJSON returns a simple JSON document. This has the same signature that we had before using ResponseWriter and Request. We create an anonymous struct, initialize it and unmarshall it into JSON and pass it down the line.

```go
func SendJSON(rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    u := struct {
        Name string
        Email string
    }{
        Name: "Hoanh An",
        Email: "hoanhan101@gmail.com",
    }

    rw.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    rw.WriteHeader(200)
    json.NewEncoder(rw).Encode(&u)
}
```

###### Example Test

This is another type of test in Go. Examples are both tests and documentations. If we execute "godoc -http :3000", Go will generate for us a server that presents the documentation of our code. The interface will look like the official golang interface, but then inside the Packages section are our local packages.

Example functions are a little bit more concrete in terms of showing people how to use our API. More interestingly, Examples are not only for documentation but they can also be tests.

For them to be tested, we need to add a comment at the end of the functions: one is Output and one is expected output. If we change the expected output to be something wrong then, the compiler will tell us when we run the test. Below is an example.

Example tests are really powerful. They give users examples how to use the API and validate that the APIs and examples are working.

```go
package handlers_test

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "net/http/httptest"
)
```

ExampleSendJSON provides a basic example. Notice that we are binding that Example to our SendJSON function.

```go
func ExampleSendJSON() {
    r := httptest.NewRequest("GET", "/sendjson", nil)
    w := httptest.NewRecorder()
    http.DefaultServeMux.ServeHTTP(w, r)

    var u struct {
        Name string
        Email string
    }

    if err := json.NewDecoder(w.Body).Decode(&u); err != nil {
        log.Println("ERROR:", err)
    }

    fmt.Println(u)
    // Output:
    // {Hoanh An hoanhan101@gmail.com}
}
```

```text
=== RUN ExampleSendJSON
--- PASS: ExampleSendJSON (0.00s)
PASS
ok      github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go/go/testing/web_server/handlers 0.096s
```

###### Internal Test

Below is how to test the execution of an internal endpoint without having to stand up the server. Run test using "go test -v -run TestSendJSON"

We are using handlers_test for package name because we want to make sure we only touch the exported API.

```go
package handlers_test

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "net/http"
    "net/http/httptest"
    "testing"
    "github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go/go/testing/web_server/handlers"
)

const (
    succeed = "\u2713"
    failed  = "\u2717"
)
```

This is very critical. If we forget to do this then nothing will work.

```go
func init() {
    handlers.Routes()
}
```

TestSendJSON testing the sendjson internal endpoint.
In order to mock this call, we don't need the network. What we need to do is create a request and run it through the Mux so we are gonna bypass the network call together, run the request directly through the Mux to test the route and the handler.

```go
func TestSendJSON(t *testing.T) {
    url := "/sendjson"
    statusCode := 200

    t.Log("Given the need to test the SendJSON endpoint.")
    {
```

Create a nil request GET for the URL.

```go
        r := httptest.NewRequest("GET", url, nil)
```

NewRecorder gives us a pointer to its concrete type called ResponseRecorder that already implements the ResponseWriter interface.

```go
        w := httptest.NewRecorder()
```

ServerHTTP asks for a ResonseWriter and a Request. This call will perform the Mux and call that handler to test it without network. When his call comes back, the recorder value w has the result of the entire execution. Now we can use that to validate.

```go
        http.DefaultServeMux.ServeHTTP(w, r)

        t.Logf("\tTest 0:\tWhen checking %q for status code %d", url, statusCode)
        {
            if w.Code != 200 {
                t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould receive a status code of %d for the response. Received[%d]", failed, statusCode, w.Code)
            }
            t.Logf("\t%s\tShould receive a status code of %d for the response.", succeed, statusCode)
```

If we got the 200, we try to unmarshal and validate it.

```go
            var u struct {
                Name  string
                Email string
            }

            if err := json.NewDecoder(w.Body).Decode(&u); err != nil {
                t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould be able to decode the response.", failed)
            }
            t.Logf("\t%s\tShould be able to decode the response.", succeed)

            if u.Name == "Hoanh An" {
                t.Logf("\t%s\tShould have \"Hoanh An\" for Name in the response.", succeed)
            } else {
                t.Errorf("\t%s\tShould have \"Hoanh An\" for Name in the response : %q", failed, u.Name)
            }

            if u.Email == "hoanhan101@gmail.com" {
                t.Logf("\t%s\tShould have \"hoanhan101@gmail.com\" for Email in the response.", succeed)
            } else {
                t.Errorf("\t%s\tShould have \"hoanhan101@gmail.com\" for Email in the response : %q", failed, u.Email)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### Mock Server

Those basic tests that we just went through were cool but had a flaw: they require the use of the Internet. We cannot assume that we always have access to the resources we need. Therefore, mocking becomes an important part of testing in many cases. (Mocking databases if not the case here because it is hard to do so but other networking related things, we surely can do that).

The standard library already has the http test package that let us mock different http stuff right out of the box. Below is how to mock an http GET call internally.

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/xml"
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "net/http/httptest"
    "testing"
)

feed is mocking the XML document we expect to receive. Noteice that we are using backtick ` instead of double quotes \" so we can reservce special characters.

```go
var feed = `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss>
<channel>

```

Item defines the fields associated with the item tag in the mock RSS document.

```go
type Item struct {
    XMLName     xml.Name `xml:"item"`
    Title       string   `xml:"title"`
    Description string   `xml:"description"`
    Link        string   `xml:"link"`
}
```

Channel defince the fields associated with the channel tag in the mock RSS document

```go
type Channel struct {
    XMLName     xml.Name `xml:"channel"`
    Title       string   `xml:"title"`
    Description string   `xml:"description"`
    Link        string   `xml:"link"`
    PubDate     string   `xml:"pubDate"`
    Items       []Item   `xml:"item"`
}
```

Document defines the fields associated with teh mock RSS document.

```go
type Document struct {
    XMLName xml.Name `xml:"rss"`
    Channel Channel  `xml:"channel"`
    URI     string
}
```

mockServer returns a pointer of type httptest.Server to handle the mock get call. This mock function calls NewServer function that is gonna stand up a web server for us automatically. All we have to give NewServer is a function of the Handler type, which is f. f creates an anonymous function with the signature of ResponseWriter and Request. This is the core signature of everything related to http in Go. ResponseWriter is an interface that allows us to write the response out. Normally when we get this interface value, there is already a concrete type value stored inside of it that supports what we are doing.

Request is a concrete type that we are gonna get with the request. This is how it's gonna work. We are gonna get a mock server started by making a NewServer call. When the request comes into it, execute f. Therefore, f is doing the entire mock. We are gonna send 200 down the line, set the header to XML and use Fprintln to take the Response Writer interface value and feed it with the raw string we defined above.

```go
func mockServer() *httptest.Server {
    f := func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        w.WriteHeader(200)
        w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/xml")
        fmt.Fprintln(w, feed)
    }
    return httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(f))
}
```

TestWeb validates the http Get function can download content and the content can be unmarshalled and clean.

```go
func TestWeb(t *testing.T) {
    statusCode := http.StatusOK
```

Call the mock server and defer close to shut it down cleanly

```go
    server := mockServer()
    defer server.Close()
```

Now, it's just the matter of using server value to know what URL we need to use to run this mock. From the http.Get point of view, it is making an URL call. It has no idea that it's hitting the mock server. We have mocked out a perfect response.

```go
    t.Log("Given the need to test downloading content.")
    {
        t.Logf("\tTest 0:\tWhen checking %q for status code %d", server.URL, statusCode)
        {
            resp, err := http.Get(server.URL)
            if err != nil {
                t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call : %v", failed, err)
            }
            t.Logf("\t%s\tShould be able to make the Get call.", succeed)

            defer resp.Body.Close()

            if resp.StatusCode != statusCode {
                t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code : %v", failed, statusCode, resp.StatusCode)
            }
            t.Logf("\t%s\tShould receive a %d status code.", succeed, statusCode)
```

When we get the response back, we are unmarshaling it from XML to our struct type and do some extra validation with that as we go.

```go
            var d Document
            if err := xml.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&d); err != nil {
                t.Fatalf("\t%s\tShould be able to unmarshal the response : %v", failed, err)
            }
            t.Logf("\t%s\tShould be able to unmarshal the response.", succeed)

            if len(d.Channel.Items) == 1 {
                t.Logf("\t%s\tShould have 1 item in the feed.", succeed)
            } else {
                t.Errorf("\t%s\tShould have 1 item in the feed : %d", failed, len(d.Channel.Items))
            }
        }
    }
}
```
