### Benchmarking

#### Basic Benchmark

Benchmark file's have to have `<file_name>_test.go` and use the Benchmark functions like below. The goal is to know what performs better and what allocate more or less between Sprint and Sprintf. Our guess is that Sprint is gonna be better because it doesn't have any overhead doing the formatting. However, this is not true. Remember we have to optimize for correctness so we don't want to guess.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "testing"
)
var gs string
```

BenchmarkSprint tests the performance of using Sprint. All the code we want to benchmark need to be inside the b.N for loop. The first time the tool call it, b.N is equal to 1. It will keep increasing the value of N and run long enough based on our bench time. fmt.Sprint returns a value and we want to capture this value so it doesn't look like dead code. We assign it to the global variable gs.

```go
func BenchmarkSprintBasic(b *testing.B) {
    var s string

    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        s = fmt.Sprint("hello")
    }
    gs = s
}
```

BenchmarkSprint tests the performance of using Sprintf.

```go
func BenchmarkSprintfBasic(b *testing.B) {
    var s string
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        s = fmt.Sprintf("hello")
    }
    gs = s
}
```

`go test -run none -bench . -benchtime 3s -benchmem`

```text
goos: darwin
goarch: amd64
BenchmarkSprintBasic-16     52997451    56.9 ns/op    5 B/op    1 allocs/op
BenchmarkSprintfBasic-16    72737234    45.7 ns/op    5 B/op    1 allocs/op
PASS
ok  command-line-arguments  6.637s
```

#### Sub Benchmark

Like sub tests, we can also do sub benchmark.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "testing"
)
```

BenchmarkSprint tests all the Sprint related benchmarks as sub benchmarks.

```go
func BenchmarkSprintSub(b *testing.B) {
    b.Run("none", benchSprint)
    b.Run("format", benchSprintf)
}
```

benchSprint tests the performance of using Sprint.

```go
func benchSprint(b *testing.B) {
    var s string

    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        s = fmt.Sprint("hello")
    }
    gs = s
}
```

benchSprintf tests the performance of using Sprintf.

```go
func benchSprintf(b *testing.B) {
    var s string

    for i := 0; i<b.N; i++ {
        s = fmt.Sprintf("hello")
    }
    gs = s
}
```

`go test -run none -bench . -benchtime 3s -benchmem`

```text
goos: darwin
goarch: amd64
BenchmarkSprintSub/none-16    54088082    60.6 ns/op    5 B/op    1 allocs/op
BenchmarkSprintSub/format-16  67906119    52.3 ns/op    5 B/op    1 allocs/op
PASS
ok command-line-arguments 7.131s
```

Other running subtests like so:

- `go test -run none -bench BenchmarkSprintSub/none -benchtime 3s -benchmem`
- `go test -run none -bench BenchmarkSprintSub/format -benchtime 3s -benchmem`

### Profiling

#### Stack Trace

##### Review Stack Trace

How to read stack traces?

```go
package main

func main() {
```

We are making a slice of length 2, capacity 4 and then passing that slice value into a function call example. example takes a slice, a string, and an integer.

```go
    example(make([]string, 2, 4), "hello", 10)
}
```

examples call the built-in function panic to demonstrate the stack traces.

```go
func example(slice []string, str string, i int) {
    panic("Want stack trace")
}
```

This is the output that we get:

```text
panic: Want stack trace

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.example(0xc420053f38, 0x2, 0x4, 0x1066c02, 0x5, 0xa)

/Users/hoanhan/go/src/github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go/go/profiling/stack_trace.go:18 +0x39
main.main()

/Users/hoanhan/go/src/github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go/go/profiling/stack_trace.go:13 +0x72
exit status 2
```

We already know that the compiler tells us the lines of problems. That's good. What is even better is that we know exactly what values are passed to the function at the time stack traces occur. Stack traces show words of data at a time. We know that a slice is a 3-word data structure. In our case, the 1st word is a pointer, 2nd is 2 (length) and 3rd is 4 (capacity). String is a 2-word data structure: a pointer and length of 5 because there are 5 bytes in string "hello". Then we have a 1 word integer of value 10.
In the stack traces, main.example(0xc420053f38, 0x2, 0x4, 0x1066c02, 0x5, 0xa), the corresponding values in the function are address, 2, 4, address, 5, a (which is 10 in base 2).

If we ask for the data we need, this is a benefit that we can get just by looking at the stack traces and see the values that are going in. If we work with the error package from Dave, wrap it and add more context, and log package, we have more than enough information to debug a problem.

##### Packing

Sample stack races that pack values.

```go
package main

func main() {
```

Passing values that are 1-byte values.

```go
    example(true, false, true, 25)
}

func example(b1, b2, b3 bool, i uint8) {
    panic("Want stack trace")
}
```

This is the output that we get:

```text
panic: Want stack trace

goroutine 1 [running]:
main.example(0xc419010001)

/Users/hoanhan/go/src/github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go/go/profiling/stack_trace_2.go:12 +0x39
main.main()

/Users/hoanhan/go/src/github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go/go/profiling/stack_trace_2.go:8 +0x29
exit status 2
```

Since stack traces show 1 word at a time, all of these 4 bytes fit in a half-word on a 32-bit platform and a full word on 64-bit. Also, the system we are looking at is using little endian so we need to read from right to left. In our case, the word value 0xc419010001 can be represented as:

| Bits  | Binary    | Hex | Value |
| :---- | :-------- | :-- | :---- |
| 00-07 | 0000 0001 | 01  | true  |
| 08-15 | 0000 0000 | 00  | false |
| 16-23 | 0000 0001 | 01  | true  |
| 24-31 | 0001 1001 | 19  | 25    |

#### GODEBUG

##### Memory Tracing

Memory Tracing gives us a general idea if our software is healthy as related to the GC and memory in the heap that we are working with. Below is a sample program that causes memory leaks.

```go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "os/signal"
)

func main() {
```

Create a Goroutine that leaks memory. Dumping key-value pairs to put tons of allocation.

```go
    go func() {
        m := make(map[int]int)
        for i := 0; ; i++ {
            m[i] = i
        }
    }()
```

Shutdown the program with Ctrl-C.

```go
    sig := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(sig)
    <-sig
}
```

We are using a special environmental variable called `GODEBUG`. It gives us the ability to do a memory trace and a scheduler trace. Here are the steps to build and run:

Build the program by: `go build memory_tracing.go`

Run the binary: `GODEBUG=gctrace=1 ./memory_tracing`

Setting the `GODEBUG=gctrace=1` causes the garbage collector to emit a single line to standard error at each collection, summarizing the amount of memory collected and the length of the pause.

What we are gonna see are bad traces followed by this pattern:

gc {0} @{1}s {2}%: {3}+...+{4} ms clock, {5}+...+{6} ms cpu, {7}->{8}->{9} MB, {10} MB goal, {11} P

where:  
 {0} : The number of times gc run  
 {1} : The amount of time the program has been running.  
 {2} : The percentage of CPU the gc is taking away from us.  
 {3} : Stop of wall clock time - a measure of the real time including time that passes due to programmed delays or waiting for resources to become available.  
 {4} : Stop of wall clock. This is normally a more important number to look at.  
 {5} : CPU clock  
 {6} : CPU clock  
 {7} : The size of the heap prior to the gc starting.  
 {8} : The size of the heap after the gc run.  
 {9} : The size of the live heap.  
 {10}: The goal of the gc, pacing algorithm.  
 {11}: The number of processes.

Here’s the actual output for the run:

```text
gc 1 @0.007s 0%: 0.010+0.13+0.030 ms clock, 0.080+0/0.058/0.15+0.24 ms cpu, 5->5->3 MB, 6 MB goal, 8 P
gc 2 @0.013s 0%: 0.003+0.21+0.034 ms clock, 0.031+0/0.030/0.22+0.27 ms cpu, 9->9->7 MB, 10 MB goal, 8 P
gc 3 @0.029s 0%: 0.003+0.23+0.030 ms clock, 0.029+0.050/0.016/0.25+0.24 ms cpu, 18->18->15 MB, 19 MB goal, 8 P
gc 4 @0.062s 0%: 0.003+0.40+0.040 ms clock, 0.030+0/0.28/0.11+0.32 ms cpu, 36->36->30 MB, 37 MB goal, 8 P
gc 5 @0.135s 0%: 0.003+0.63+0.045 ms clock, 0.027+0/0.026/0.64+0.36 ms cpu, 72->72->60 MB, 73 MB goal, 8 P
gc 6 @0.302s 0%: 0.003+0.98+0.043 ms clock, 0.031+0.078/0.016/0.88+0.34 ms cpu, 65->66->42 MB, 120 MB goal, 8 P
gc 7 @0.317s 0%: 0.003+1.2+0.080 ms clock, 0.026+0/1.1/0.13+0.64 ms cpu, 120->121->120 MB, 121 MB goal, 8 P
gc 8 @0.685s 0%: 0.004+1.6+0.041 ms clock, 0.032+0/1.5/0.72+0.33 ms cpu, 288->288->241 MB, 289 MB goal, 8 P
gc 9 @1.424s 0%: 0.004+4.0+0.081 ms clock, 0.033+0.027/3.8/0.53+0.65 ms cpu, 577->577->482 MB, 578 MB goal, 8 P
gc 10 @2.592s 0%: 0.003+11+0.045 ms clock, 0.031+0/5.9/5.2+0.36 ms cpu, 499->499->317 MB, 964 MB goal, 8 P
```

It goes really fast in the beginning and starts to slow down. This is bad. The size of the heap is increasing every time the GC runs. Hence, we know that there is a memory leak.
