### Patterns 164

#### Context 164

##### Store and retrieve values from a context 164

##### WithCancel 166

##### WithDeadline

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

type data struct {
    UserID string
}

func main() {
```

Set a deadline.

```go
    deadline := time.Now().Add(150 * time.Millisecond)
```

Create a context that is both manually cancellable and will signal a cencel at the specified data/time.
We use `Background` as our parents context and set out deadline time.

```go
    ctx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(context.Background(), deadline)
    defer cancel()
```

Create a channel to received a signal that work is done.

```go
   ch := make(chan data, 1)
```

Ask a Goroutine to do some work for us.

```go
    go func() {
```

Simulate work.

```go
        time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)
```

Report the work is done.

```go
        ch <- data{"123"}
    }()
```

Wait for the work to finish.
If it takes too long move on.

```go
    select {
    case d := <-ch:
        fmt.Println("work complete", d)
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("work cancelled")

    }
}
```

```terminal
work cancelled
```
