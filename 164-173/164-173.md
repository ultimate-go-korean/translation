Sample program that implements a web request with a context
that is used to timeout the request if it takes too long.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "io"
    "log"
    "net"
    "net/http"
    "os"
    "time"
)

func main() {
```

Create a new request

```go
    req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/post/index.xml", nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err)
        return
    }
```

Create a context with a timeout of 50 milliseconds.

```go
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(req.Context(), 50 * time.Millisecond)
    defer cancel()
```

Declare a new transport and client for the call.

```go
    tr := http.Transport {
        Proxy: http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
        DialContext: (&net.DialerP{
            Timeout:   30 * time.Second,
            Timeout:   30 * time.Second,
            DualStack: true,
        }).DialContext,
        MaxIdleConns:          100,
        IdleConnTimeout:       90 * time.Second,
        TLSHandshakeTimeout:   10 * time.Second,
        ExpectContinueTimeout: 1 * time.Second,
    }
    client := http.Client{
        Transport: &tr,
    }
```

Make the web call in a separate Goroutine so it can be cancelled.

```go
    ch := make(chan error, 1)
    go func() {
        log.Println("Starting Request")
```

Make the web call and return any `error.client.Do` is going out and trying to hit the request URL.
It's probably blocked right now because it will need to wait for the entire document to come back.

```go
        resp, err := client.Do(req)
```

If the error occurs, we perform a send on the channel to report that we are done.
We are going to use this channel at some point to report back what is happening.

```go
        if err != nil {
            ch <- err
            return
        }
```

If it doesn't fail, we close the response body on the return.

```go
        defer resp.Body.Close()
```

Write the response to `stdout`.

```go
        io.Copy(os.Stdout, resp.Body)
```

Then, send back the `nil` instead of `error`.

```go
        ch <- nil
    }()
```

Wait the request or timeout.
We perform a receive on `ctx.Done()` saying that we want to wait 50 ms for that whole process above to happen.
If it doesn't, we signal back to that Goroutine to cancel the sending request.
We don't have to just walk away and let that eat up resources and finish because we are not going to need it.
We are able to call `CancelRequest` and underneath, we are able to kill that connection.

```go
    select {
    case <-ctx.Done():
        log.Println("timeout, cancel work...")
        tr.CancelRequest(req)
        log.Println(<-ch)
    case err := <-ch:
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
        }
    }
}
```

```terminal
2020/08/24 18:37:18 Starting Request
2020/08/24 18:37:18 timeout, cancel work...
2020/08/24 18:37:18 Get https://wwww.ardanlabs.com/blog/post/index.xml:
net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection
```
