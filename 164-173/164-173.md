```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

type data struct {
    UserID string
}

func main (){
```

Set a duration

```go
    duration := 150 * time.Millisecond
```

Create a context that is both manually cancellable and will signal a cancel at the specified duration.

```go
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), duration)
    defer cancel()
```

Create a channel to received a signal that work is done.

```go
    ch := make(chan data, 1)
```

Ask the goroutine to do some work for us,

```go
    go func() {
```

Simulate work.

```go
        time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
```

Report the work is done.

```go
        ch <- data{"123"}
    }()
```

Wait for the work to finish.
If it takes too long, move on.

```go
    select {
    case d := <-ch:
        fmt.Println("work complete", d)
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("work cancelled")
    }
}
```

```terminal
work complete {123}
```
