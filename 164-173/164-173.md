### Patterns

#### Context

##### Store and retrieve values from a context

Context package is the answer to cancellation and deadline in Go.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
)
```

`user` is the type of value to store in the context.

```go
type user struct {
    name string
}
```

`userKey` is the type of value to user for the key.
The key is type of specific and only values of the same type will match.
When we store a value inside a context,
what getting stored is not just a value but also a type associated with the storage.
We can only pull a value out of that context if we know the type of value that we are looking for.
The idea of this `userKey` type becomes really important when we want to store a value inside the context.

```go
type userKey int

func main()
```

Create a value of type `user`.

```go
    u := user {
        name: "Hoanh",
    }
```

Declare a key with the value of zero of type

```go
    const uk userKey = 0
```

Store the pointer to the user value inside the context with a value of zero of type `userKey`.
We are using `context.WithValue` because a new context value and we want to initialise that with data to begin with.
Anytime we work a context, the context has to have a parent context.
This is where the `Background` function comes in.
We are gonna store the key `uk` to its value (which is `0` in this case),
and address of user.

```go
    ctx := context.WithValue(context.Background(), uk, &u)
```

Retrieve that user `user` pointer back by `user` the same key type value.
Value allows us to pass the key of the corrected type (in our case is `uk` of `userKey` type)
and returns an empty interface.
Because we are working with an interface, we have to perform a type assertion to pull the value
that we store in there out the interface so we can work with the concrete again.

```go
    if u, ok := ctx.Value(uk).(*user); ok {
        fmt.Println("User", u.name) // note(tangoenskai): original script has typo, I did `s/u.nam/u.name`
    }
```

Attempt to retrieve the value again using the same value but of a different type.
Even though the key value is `0`, if we just pass `0` into this function call,
we are not going to get back that address to the user because `0` is based on integer type,
not our `userKey` type.

It is important that when we store the value inside the context not to user the built-in type.

Declare our own key type.
That way, only us and who understand that type can pull that out.
Because what if multiple partial programs want to user that value of `0`,
we are all being tripped up on each other.
That type extends an extra level of protection of being able to store and retrieve value out of context.
If we are using this,
we want to raise a flag because we have to ask twice why we want to do that instead of passing down the call stack.
Because if we can pass it down the call stack,
it would be much better for readability and maintainability for our legacy code in the future.

```go
    if _, ok := ctx.Value(0).(*user); !ok {
        fmt.Println("User Not Found")
    }
```

```terminal
User Hoanh
User Not Found
```
