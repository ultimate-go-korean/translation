### Decoupling

#### Method

##### Value and Pointer Receiver Call

```go
type user struct {
    name  string
    email string
}
```

notify implements a method with a value receiver: u of type user In Go, a function
is called a method if that function has a receiver declared within itself. It
looks and feels like a parameter but it is exactly what it is. Using the value
receiver, the method operates on its own copy of the value that is used to make
the call.

```go
func (u user) notify() {
    fmt.Printf("Sending User Email To %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}
```

changeEmail implements a method with a pointer receiver: u of type pointer user,
Using the pointer receiver, the method operates on shared access.

```go
func (u *user) changeEmail(email string) {
    u.email = email
    fmt.Printf("Changed User Email To %s\n", email)
}
```

These 2 methods above are just for studying the difference between a value
receiver and a pointer receiver. In production, we will have to ask yourself why
we choose to use inconsistent receiver's type. We will talk about this later on.

**Value and pointer receiver call**

Values of type user can be used to call methods declared with both value and
pointer receivers.

```go
bill := user{"Bill", "bill@email.com"}
bill.notify()
bill.changeEmail("bill@hotmail.com")
```

```
Sending User Email To Bill<bill@email.com>
Changed User Email To bill@hotmail.com
```

Pointers of type user can also be used to call methods declared with both value
and pointer receiver.

```go
hoanh := &user{"Hoanh", "hoanhan@email.com"}
hoanh.notify()
hoanh.changeEmail("hoanhan101@gmail.com")
```

```
Sending User Email To Hoanh<hoanhan@email.com>
Changed User Email To hoanhan101@gmail.com
```

hoanh in this example is a pointer that has the type *user. We are still able to
call notify. This is still correct. As long as we deal with the type user, Go can
adjust to make the call. Behind the scene, we have something like
(*hoanh).notify(). Go will take the value that hoanh points to and make sure that
notify leverages its value semantic and works on its own copy. Similarly, bill has
the type user but still be able to call changeEmail. Go will take the address of
bill and do the rest for you: (&bill).changeEmail().

Create a slice of user values with two users.

```go
users := []user{
    {"bill", "bill@email.com"},
    {"hoanh", "hoanh@email.com"},
}
```

We are ranging over this slice of values, making a copy of each value and call
notify to make another copy.

```go
for _, u := range users {
    u.notify()
}
```

```
Sending User Email To bill<bill@email.com>
Sending User Email To Hoanh<hoanhan@email.com>
```

Iterate over the slice of users switching semantics. This is not a good practice.

```go
for _, u := range users {
    u.changeEmail("it@wontmatter.com")
}
```

```
Changed User Email To it@wontmatter.com
Changed User Email To it@wontmatter.com
```

##### Value and Pointer Semantics

When it comes to using built-in type (numeric, string, bool), we should always be
using value semantics. When a piece of code that takes an address of an integer or
a bool, this raises a big flag. It's hard to say because it depends on the
context. But in general, why should these values end up on the heap creating
garbage? These should be on the stack. There is an exception to everything.
However, until we know it is okay to take the exception, we should follow the
guideline.

The reference type (slice, map, channel, interface) also focuses on using value
semantics. The only time we want to take the address of a slice is when we are
sharing it down the call stack to the Unmarshal function since it always requires
the address of a value.

Examples below are from the standard library. By studying them, we learn how
important it is to use value or pointer semantics in a consistent way.
When we declare a type, we must ask ourselves immediately:

- Does this type require value semantic or pointer semantic?
- If I need to modify this value, should we create a new value or should we
  modify the value itself so everyone can see it?

It needs to be consistent. It is okay to guess it wrong the first time and
refactor it later.

```go
package main

import (
    "sync/atomic"
    "syscall"
)
```

**Value semantic**

These are named types from the net package called IP and IPMask with base types
that are slices of bytes. Since we use value semantics for reference types, the
implementation is using value semantics for both.

```go
type IP []byte
type IPMask []byte
```

Mask is using a value receiver and returning a value of type IP. This method is
using value semantics for type IP.

```go
func (ip IP) Mask(mask IPMask) IP {
    if len(mask) == IPv6len && len(ip) == IPv4len && allFF(mask[:12]) {
        mask = mask[12:]
    }
    if len(mask) == IPv4len && len(ip) == IPv6len &&
        bytesEqual(ip[:12], v4InV6Prefix) {
        ip = ip[12:]
    }
    n := len(ip)
    if n != len(mask) {
        return nil
    }
    out := make(IP, n)
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        out[i] = ip[i] & mask[i]
    }
    return out
}
```

ipEmptyString accepts a value of type IP and returns a value of type string. The
function is using value semantics for type IP.

```go
func ipEmptyString(ip IP) string {
    if len(ip) == 0 {
        return ""
    }
    return ip.String()
}
```

**Pointer semantic**

Should Time use value or pointer semantics? If you need to modify a Time value,
should you mutate the value or create a new one?

```go
type Time struct {
    sec  int64
    nsec int32
    loc  *Location
}
```

The best way to understand what semantic is going to be used is to look at the
factory function for type. It dictates the semantics that will be used. In this
example, the Now function returns a value of type Time. It is making a copy of its
Time value and passing it back up. This means Time value can be on the stack. We
should be using value semantic all the way through.

```go
func Now() Time {
    sec, nsec := now()
    return Time{sec + unixToInternal, nsec, Local}
}
```

Add is a mutation operation. If we go with the idea that we should be using
pointer semantic when we mutate something and value semantic when we don't then
Add is implemented wrong. However, it has not been wrong because it is the type
that has to drive the semantic, not the implementation of the method. The method
must adhere to the semantic that we choose.

Add is using a value receiver and returning a value of type Time. It is mutating
its local copy and returning to us something new.

```go
func (t Time) Add(d Duration) Time {
    t.sec += int64(d / 1e9)
    nsec := int32(t.nsec) + int32(d%1e9)
    if nsec >= 1e9 {
        t.sec++
        nsec -= 1e9
    } else if nsec <  0  {
        t.sec--
        nsec += 1e9
    }
    t.nsec = nsec
    return t
}
```

div accepts a value of type Time and returns values of built-in types.
The function is using value semantics for type Time.

```go
func div(t Time, d Duration) (qmod2 int, r Duration) {}
```

The only use of pointer semantics for the Time API are these Unmarshal-related
functions:

```go
func (t *Time) UnmarshalBinary(data []byte) error {}
func (t *Time) GobDecode(data []byte) error {}
func (t *Time) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error {}
func (t *Time) UnmarshalText(data []byte) error {}
```

Most struct types are not going to be able to leverage value semantic. Most struct
types are probably gonna be data that should be shared or more efficient to be
shared. For example, an User type. Regardless, it is possible to copy an User type
but it is not a proper thing to do in the real world.

Other examples:

Factory functions dictate the semantics that will be used. The Open function
returns a pointer of type File. This means we should be using pointer semantics
and share File values.

```go
func Open(name string) (file *File, err error) {
    return OpenFile(name, O_RDONLY, 0)
}
```

Chdir is using a pointer receiver. This method is using pointer semantics for
File.

```go
func (f *File) Chdir() error {
    if f == nil {
        return ErrInvalid
    }
    if e := syscall.Fchdir(f.fd); e != nil {
        return &PathError{"chdir", f.name, e}
    }
    return nil
}
```

epipecheck accepts a pointer of type File. The function is using pointer semantics
for type File.

```go
func epipecheck(file *File, e error) {
    if e == syscall.EPIPE {
        if atomic.AddInt32(&file.nepipe, 1) >= 10 {
            sigpipe()
        }
    } else {
        atomic.StoreInt32(&file.nepipe, 0)
    }
}
```

##### Methods are just functions

Methods are really just made up. They are not real. They are just syntactic sugar.
They give us a belief system that some pieces of data expose some capabilities.
Object-oriented programming has driven design and capabilities. However, there is
no OOP in Go. There is data and behavior.

At some time, data can expose some capabilities, but for specific purposes, not to
really design API around. Methods are really just functions.

```go
type​ data ​struct​ {
    name ​string
    age ​ int
}
```

displayName provides a pretty print view of the name. It uses data as a value
receiver.

```go
func (d data) displayName() {
    fmt.Println("My Name Is", d.name)
}
```

setAge sets the age and displays the value. It uses data as a pointer receiver.

```go
func (d *data) setAge(age int) {
    d.age = age
    fmt.Println(d.name, "Is Age", d.age)
}
```

**Methods are just functions**

Declare a variable of type data.

```go
d := data{
    name: "Hoanh",
}
fmt.Println("Proper Calls to Methods:")
```

How we actually call methods in Go.

```go
d.displayName()
d.setAge(21)

fmt.Println("\nWhat the Compiler is Doing:")
```

This is what Go is doing underneath. When we call d.displayName(), the compiler
will call data.displayName, showing that we are using a value receiver of type
data, and pass the data in as the first parameter. Taking a look at the function
again: "func (d data) displayName()", that receiver is the parameter because it is
truly a parameter. It is the first parameter to a function that calls displayName.

Similar to d.setAge(45). Go is calling a function that is based on the pointer
receiver and passing data to its parameters. We are adjusting to make the call by
taking the address of d.

```go
data.displayName(d)
(*data).setAge(&d, 21)
```

```
Proper Calls to Methods:
My Name Is Hoanh
Hoanh Is Age 21

What the Compiler is Doing:
My Name Is Hoanh
Hoanh Is Age 21
```

**Function variable**

```go
fmt.Println("\nCall Value Receiver Methods with Variable:")
```

Declare a function variable for the method bound to the d variable. The function
variable will get its own copy of d because the method is using a value receiver.
f1 is now a reference type: a pointer variable. We don't call the method here.
There is no () at the end of displayName.

```go
f1 := d.displayName
```

Call the method via the variable.

f1 is pointer and it points to a special 2 word data structure. The first word
points to the code for that method we want to execute, which is displayName in
this case. We cannot call displayName unless we have a value of type data. So the
second word is a pointer to the copy of data. displayName uses a value receiver so
it works on its own copy. When we make an assignment to f1, we are having a copy
of d.

When we change the value of d to "Hoanh An", f1 is not going to see the change.

```go
d.name = "Hoanh An"
```

Call the method via the variable. We don't see the change.

```go
f1()
```

```
Call Value Receiver Methods with Variable:
My Name Is Hoanh
My Name Is Hoanh
```

However, if we do this again if f2, then we will see the change.

```go
fmt.Println("\nCall Pointer Receiver Method with Variable:")
```

Declare a function variable for the method bound to the d variable. The function
variable will get the address of d because the method is using a pointer receiver.

```go
f2 := d.setAge
d.name = "Hoanh An Dinh"
```

Call the method via the variable. f2 is also a pointer that has 2 word data
structure. The first word points to setAge, but the second word doesn't point to
its copy any more, but to its original.

```go
f2(21)
```

```
Call Pointer Receiver Method with Variable:
Hoanh An Dinh Is Age 21
```

#### Interface

##### Valueless type

reader is an interface that defines the act of reading data. interface is
technically a valueless type. This interface doesn't declare state. It defines a
contract of behavior. Through that contract of behavior, we have polymorphism. It
is a 2 word data structure that has 2 pointers. When we say var r reader, we would
have a nil value interface because interface is a reference type.

```go
type reader interface {
    read(b []byte) (int, error) // (1)
}
```

We could have written this API a little bit differently. Technically, I could have
said: How many bytes do you want me to read and I will return that slice of byte
and an error, like so: read(i int) ([]byte, error) (2).

Why do we choose the other one instead?

Every time we call (2), it will cost an allocation because the method would have
to allocate a slice of some unknown type and share it back up the call stack. The
method would have to allocate a slice of some unknown type and share it back up
the call stack. The backing array for that slice has to be an allocation. But if
we stick with (1), the caller is allocating a slice. Even the backing array for
that is ended up on a heap, it is just 1 allocation. We can call this 10000 times
and it is still 1 allocation.

**Concrete type vs Interface type**

A concrete type is any type that can have a method. Only user defined types can
have a method.

Method allows a piece of data to expose capabilities, primarily around interfaces.
file defines a system file.

It is a concrete type because it has the method read below. It is identical to the
method in the reader interface. Because of this, we can say the concrete type file
implements the reader interface using a value receiver.

There is no fancy syntax. The compiler can automatically recognize the
implementation here.

**Relationship**

We store concrete type values inside interfaces.

```go
type file struct {
    name string
}
```

read implements the reader interface for a file.

```go
func (file) read(b []byte) (int, error) {
    s := "<rss><channel><title>Going Go Programming</title></channel></rss>"
    copy(b, s)
    return len(s), nil
}
```

pipe defines a named pipe network connection. This is the second concrete type
that uses a value receiver. We now have two different pieces of data, both
exposing the reader's contract and implementation for this contract.

```go
type pipe struct {
    name string
}
```

read implements the reader interface for a network connection.

```go
func (pipe) read(b []byte) (int, error) {
    s := `{name: "hoanh", title: "developer"}`
    copy(b, s)
    return len(s), nil
}
```

Create two values one of type file and one of type pipe.

```go
f := file{"data.json"}
p := pipe{"cfg_service"}
```

Call the retrieve function for each concrete type. Here we are passing the value
itself, which means a copy of f going to pass across the program boundary.

The compiler will ask: Does this file value implement the reader interface?
The answer is Yes, because there is a method there using the value receiver that
implements its contract. The second word of the interface value will store its own
copy of f. The first word points to a special data structure that we call the
iTable.

The iTable serves 2 purposes:

- The first part describes the type of value being stored. In our case, it is
  the file value.
- The second part gives us a matrix of function pointers so we can actually
  execute the right method when we call that through the interface.

![iTable for `file`](../diagrams/48.jpg)

When we do a read against the interface, we can do an iTable lookup, find that
read associated with this type, then call that value against the read method - the
concrete implementation of read for this type of value.

```go
retrieve(f)
```

Similar with p. Now the first word of reader interface points to pipe, not file
and the second word points to a copy of pipe value.

![iTable for `pipe`](../diagrams/49-1.jpg)

The behavior changes because the data changes.

```go
retrieve(p)
```

Later on, for simplicity, instead of drawing the a pointer pointing to iTable, we
only draw \*pipe, like so:

![simple representation](../diagrams/49-2.jpg)

**Polymorphic function**

retrieve can read any device and process the data. This is called a polymorphic
function. The parameter is being used here is the reader type. But it is
valueless. What does it mean? This function will accept any data that implement
the reader contract. This function knows nothing about the concrete and it is
completely decoupled. It is the highest level of decoupling we can get. The
algorithm is still efficient and compact. All we have is a level of indirection to
the concrete type data values in order to be able to execute the algorithm.

```go
func retrieve(r reader) error {
    data := make([]byte, 100)

    len, err := r.read(data)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    fmt.Println(string(data[:len]))
    return nil
}
```

```
<rss><channel><title>Going Go Programming</title></channel></rss>
{name: "hoanh", title: "developer"}
```

##### Interface via pointer receiver

notifier is an interface that defines notification type behavior.

```go
type notifier interface {
    notify()
}
```

printer displays information.

```go
type printer interface {
    print()
}
```

user defines a user in the program.

```go
type user struct {
    name  string
    email string
}
```

print displays user's name and email.

```go
func (u user) print() {
    fmt.Printf("My name is %s and my email is %s\n", u.name, u.email)
}
```

notify implements the notifier interface with a pointer receiver.

```go
func (u *user) notify() {
    fmt.Printf("Sending User Email To %s<%s>\n", u.name, u.email)
}
```

String implements the fmt.Stringer interface. The fmt package that we've been
using to display things on the screen, if it receives a piece of data that
implements this behavior, it will use this behavior and overwrite its default.
Since we are using pointer semantics, only pointer satisfies the interface.

```go
func (u *user) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("My name is %q and my email is %q", u.name, u.email)
}
```

Create a value of type User

```go
u := user{"Hoanh", "hoanhan@email.com"}
```

Call a polymorphic function but pass u using value semantic: sendNotification(u).
However, the compiler doesn't allow it: "cannot use u (type user) as type notifier
in argument to sendNotification:
user does not implement notifier (notify method has pointer receiver)" This is
setting up for an integrity issue.

**Method set**

In the specification, there are sets of rules around the concepts of method sets.
What we are doing is against these rules.

What are the rules?

- For any value of a given type T, only those methods implemented with a
  value receiver belong to the method sets of that type.
- For any value of a given type \*T (pointer of a given type), both value
  receiver and pointer receiver methods belong to the method sets of that
  type.

In other words, if we are working with a pointer of some type, all the methods
that have been declared are associated with that pointer. But if we are working
with a value of some types, only those methods that operated on value semantic can
be applied.

In the previous lesson about method, we are calling them before without any
problem. That is true. When we are dealing with method, method call against the
concrete values themselves, Go can adjust to make the call.
However, we are not trying to call a method here. We are trying to store a
concrete type value inside the interface. For that to happen, that value must
satisfy the contract.

The question now becomes: Why can't pointer receivers be associated with the
method sets for value? What is the integrity issue here that doesn't allow us to
use pointer semantics for value of type T?

It is not 100% guaranteed that any value that can satisfy the interface has an
address. We can never call a pointer receiver because if that value doesn't have
an address, it is not shareable. For example:

Declare a type named duration that is based on an integer

```go
type duration int
```

Declare a method name notify using a pointer receiver. This type now implements
the notifier interface using a pointer receiver.

```go
func (d *duration) notify() {
    fmt.Println("Sending Notification in", *d)
}
```

Take a value 42, convert it to type duration and try to call the notify method.
Here are what the compiler says:

- "cannot call pointer method on duration(42)"
- "cannot take the address of duration(42)"

```go
duration(42).notify()
```

Why can't we get the address? Because 42 is not stored in a variable. It is still
literal value that we don't know ahead the type. Yet it still does implement the
notifier interface.

Come back to our example, when we get the error, we know that we are mixing
semantics. u implements the interface using a pointer receiver and now we are
trying to work with a copy of that value, instead of trying to share it. It is not
consistent.

**The lesson**

If we implement an interface using a pointer receiver, we must use pointer
semantics. If we implement an interface using value receiver, we then have the
ability to use value semantic and pointer semantic. However, for consistency, we
want to use value semantics most of the time, unless we are doing something like
an Unmarshal function.

To fix the issue, instead of passing value u, we must pass the address of u (&u).
We create a user value and pass the address of that, which means the interface now
has a pointer of type user and we get to point to the original value.

![pointer of `u`](../diagrams/53.jpg)

```go
sendNotification(&u)
```

This is our polymorphic function. sendNotification accepts values that implement
the notifier interface and sends notifications. This is again saying: I will
accept any value or pointer that implements the notifier interface. I will call
that behavior against the interface itself.

```go
func sendNotification(n notifier) {
    n.notify()
}
```

Similarly, when we pass a value of u to Println, in the output we only see the
default formatting. When we pass the address through, it now can overwrite it.

```go
fmt.Println(u)
fmt.Println(&u)
```

```
Sending User Email To Hoanh<hoanhan@email.com>
{Hoanh hoanhan@email.com}
My name is "Hoanh" and my email is "hoanhan@email.com"
```

##### Slice of interface

Create a slice of interface values. It means that I can store in this dataset any
value or pointer that implements the printer interface.

![value and pointer](../diagrams/54.jpg)

```go
entities := []printer{
```

When we store a value, the interface value has its own copy of the value. Changes
to the original value will not be seen.

```go
    u,
```

When we store a pointer, the interface value has its own copy of the address.
Changes to the original value will be seen.

```go
    &u,
}
```

Change the name and email on the user value.

```go
u.name = "Hoanh An"
u.email = "hoanhan101@gmail.com"
```

Iterate over the slice of entities and call print against the copied interface
value.

```go
for _, e := range entities {
    e.print()
}
```

```
My name is Hoanh and my email is hoanhan@email.com
My name is Hoanh An and my email is hoanhan101@gmail.com
```
