### 데이터 구조(Data Structures)

#### 배열(Array)

##### CPU Cache

Cores DO NOT access main memory directly but their local caches. What store in
caches are data and instruction.

Cache speed from fastest to slowest: L1 -> L2 -> L3 -> main memory. As Scott
Meyers has said "If performance matters then the total memory you have is the
total amount of caches". Access to main memory is incredibly slow. Practically
speaking it might not even be there.

So how do we write code that can be sympathetic with the caching system to make
sure that we don't have a cache miss or at least, we minimize cache misses to our
fullest potential?

Processor has a Prefetcher. It predicts what data is needed ahead of time. There
are different granularities depending on where we are on the machine. Our
programming model uses a byte. We can read and write to a byte at a time. However,
from the caching system point of view, our granularity is not 1 byte. It is 64
bytes, called a cache line. All memory us junked up in this 64 bytes cache line.
Since the caching mechanism is complex, Prefetcher tries to hide all the latency
from us. It has to be able to pick up on predictable access patterns to data. That
said, we need to write code that creates predictable access patterns to data.

One easy way is to create a contiguous allocation of memory and to iterate over
them. The array data structure gives us the ability to do so. From the hardware
perspective, array is the most important data structure. From Go perspective,
slice is. Array is the backing data structure for slice (like Vector in C++). Once
we allocate an array, whatever its size, every element is equally distant from
other elements. As we iterate over that array, we begin to walk cache line by
cache line. As the Prefetcher sees that access pattern, it can pick it up and hide
all the latency from us.

For example, we have a big nxn matrix. We do LinkedList Traverse, Column Traverse,
and Row Traverse and benchmark against them. Unsurprisingly, Row Traverse has the
best performance. It walks through the matrix cache line by cache line and creates
a predictable access pattern. Column Traverse does not walk through the matrix
cache line by cache line. It looks like a random access memory pattern. That is
why it is the slowest among those. However, that doesn't explain why LinkedList
Traverse's performance is in the middle. We just think that it might perform as
poorly as the Column Traverse. This leads us to another cache: TLB - Translation
Lookaside Buffer. Its job is to maintain the operating system’s page and offset to
where physical memory is.

##### Translation Lookaside Buffer

Back to the different granularity, the caching system moves data in and out the
hardware at 64 bytes at a time. However, the operating system manages memory by
paging its 4K (traditional page size for an operating system).

For every page that we are managing, let's take our virtual memory addresses
because that we use (softwares runs virtual addresses, its sandbox, that is how we
use/share physical memory) and map it to the right page and offset for that
physical memory.

A miss on the TLB can be worse than just the cache miss alone. The LinkedList is
somewhere in between because the chance of multiple nodes being on the same page
is probably pretty good. Even though we can get cache misses because cache lines
aren't necessary in the distance that is predictable, we probably do not have so
many TLB cache misses. In the Column Traverse, not only do we have cache misses,
we probably have a TLB cache miss on every access as well.

That said, data-oriented design matters. It is not enough to write the most
efficient algorithm, how we access our data can have much more lasting effect on
the performance than the algorithm itself.

##### 선언과 초기화(Declare and initialize)

길이가 5이며 문자열을 원소로 가지는 배열을 선언하고 제로 값으로 초기화 해봅시다. 복습을 해보자면, 문자열은 포인터와 길이를 표현하는 두 워드(word)로 이루어진 데이터 구조입니다. 이 배열은 제로 값으로 할당 되었기 때문에, 배열에 속해 있는 모든 문자열 또한 제로 값으로 할당 됩니다. 이것은 모든 문자열의 첫 번째 워드는 nil을 가르키고 두 번째 워드는 0이라는 의미입니다.

![22-1](../diagrams/22-1.jpg)

```go
var strings [5]string
```

인덱스 0에서 이제 문자열은 바이트들(문자열을 구성하는 문자들)을 저장하고 있는 배열(이하 backing array)에 대한 포인터를 가지며 길이는 5입니다.

##### 비용이란 무엇인가?(What is the cost?)

할당의 비용은 2 바이트를 복사하는 것에 대한 비용입니다. 우리는 같은 backing array를 가르키는 두 문자열을 가지게 됩니다. 그러므로, 할당의 비용은 2 단어에 대한 비용입니다.

```go
strings[0] = "Apple"
```

![22-2](../diagrams/22-2.jpg)

비슷하게, 슬라이스의 남은 부분에 값을 할당합니다.

```go
strings[1] = "Orange"
strings[2] = "Banana"
strings[3] = "Grape"
strings[4] = "Plum"
```

##### 문자열 배열 반복(Iterate over the array of strings)

range를 사용해서, 우리는 인덱스 뿐만 아니라 복사 된 배열의 값을 얻을 수 있습니다.
for 문 범위 내에서 fruit 변수는 이제 문자열 값을 가지게 됩니다. 첫 번째 반복에서, 단어 "Apple"를 가집니다. 이 문자열 또한 위의 이미지에 있는 (1) 배열을 가르키는 워드와 길이 5를 나타내는 두 번째 워드를 가집니다. 이제 우리는 같은 backing array를 공유하고 있는 3개의 다른 문자열을 가지게 됩니다.

**Println 함수에 무엇을 전달하나요?**

우리는 여기서 value semantics를 사용합니다. 우리는 문자열 값을 공유하지 않습니다.
Println은 자체 복사본, 자체 문자열 값을 가져옵니다. 이것은 우리가 Println을 호출 할 때 같은 backing array를 공유하는 4개의 문자열을 가지게 된다는 의미입니다. 우리는 문자열의 주소를 가지는 것을 원하지 않습니다. 우리는 문자열의 길이를 미리 알고 있습니다. 이것은 할당이 발생되지 않고 GC에 스트레스를 가하는 원인이 아니기 때문에 스택에 있을 수 있음을 의미합니다. `문자열은 가비지 생성을 방지하는 수단으로 힙에 유지되기 위해서 leverage value mechanics로 디자인되어 있습니다.<The string has been designed to leverage value mechanics, to stay on the stack, out of the way of creating garbage.>` 따라서, 힙에는 유일하게 공유 되는 한 가지인 backing array만 있습니다.

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Iterate over array\n")
for i, fruit := range strings {
    fmt.Println(i, fruit)
}
```

```
=> Iterate over array
0 Apple
1 Orange
2 Banana
3 Grape
4 Plum
```

4개의 정수로 이루어진 배열을 선언하고 리터럴 표기법(literal syntax)을 사용하여 특정 값으로 초기화 합니다.

```go
numbers := [4]int{10, 20, 30, 40}
```

전통적인 스타일을 사용해서 수의 배열을 반복합니다.

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Iterate over array using traditional style\n"​)

for i := 0;i < len(numbers);i++ {
    fmt.Println(i, numbers[i])
}
```

```
=> Iterate over array using traditional style
0 10
1 20
2 30
3 40
```

##### Different type arrays

Declare an array of 5 integers that is initialized to its zero value.

```go
var five [5]int
```

Declare an array of 4 integers that is initialized with some values.

```go
four := [4]int{10, 20, 30, 40}
```

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Different type arrays\n")
fmt.Println(five)
fmt.Println(four)
```

```
=> Different type arrays
[0 0 0 0 0]
[10 20 30 40]
```

When we try to assign four to five like so five = four, the compiler says that
"cannot use four (type [4]int) as type [5]int in assignment". This cannot happen
because they have different types (size and representation). The size of an array
makes up its type name: [4]int vs [5]int. Just like what we've seen with pointers.
The * in *int is not an operator but part of the type name. Unsurprisingly, all
arrays have known size at compile time.

##### Contiguous memory allocations

Declare an array of 6 strings initialized with values.

```go
six := [6]string{"Annie", "Betty", "Charley", "Doug", "Edward", "Hoanh"}
```

Iterate over the array displaying the value and address of each element. By
looking at the output of this Printf function, we can see that this array is truly
a contiguous block of memory. We know a string is 2 words and depending on
computer architecture, it will have x byte. The distance between two consecutive
IndexAddr is exactly x byte. v is its own variable on the stack and it has the
same address every single time.

```go
for i, v := range six {
    fmt.Printf("Value[%s]\tAddress[%p] IndexAddr[%p]\n", v, &v, &six[i])
}
```

```
=> Contiguous memory allocations
Value[Annie] Address[0xc000010250] IndexAddr[0xc000052180]
Value[Betty] Address[0xc000010250] IndexAddr[0xc000052190]
Value[Charley] Address[0xc000010250] IndexAddr[0xc0000521a0]
Value[Doug] Address[0xc000010250] IndexAddr[0xc0000521b0]
Value[Edward] Address[0xc000010250] IndexAddr[0xc0000521c0]
Value[Hoanh] Address[0xc000010250] IndexAddr[0xc0000521d0]
```

#### Slice

##### Declare and initialize

Create a slice with a length of 5 elements. make is a special built-in function
that only works with slice, map and channel. make creates a slice that has an
array of 5 strings behind it. We are getting back a 3 word data structure: the
first word points to the backing array, second word is length and third one is
capacity.

![25](../diagrams/25.jpg)

##### Length vs Capacity

Length is the number of elements from this pointer position we have access to
(read and write). Capacity is the total number of elements from this pointer
position that exist in the backing array.

Because it uses syntactic sugar, it looks just like an array. It also has the same
cost that we've seen in array. However, there’s one thing to be mindful about:
there is no value in the bracket []string inside the make function. With that in
mind, we can constantly notice that we are dealing with a slice, not array.

```go
slice1 := make([]string, 5)
slice1[0] = "Apple"
slice1[1] = "Orange"
slice1[2] = "Banana"
slice1[3] = "Grape"
slice1[4] = "Plum"
```

We can't access an index of a slice beyond its length.

```
Error: panic: runtime error: index out of range slice1[5] = "Runtime error"
```

We are passing the value of slice, not its address. So the Println function will
have its own copy of the slice.

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Printing a slice\n")
fmt.Println(slice1)
```

```
=> Printing a slice
[Apple Orange Banana Grape Plum]
```

##### Reference type

To create a slice with a length of 5 elements and a capacity of 8, we can use the
keyword ​*make*​. _make_ allows us to adjust the capacity directly on construction of
this initialization.

What we end up having now is a 3 word data structure where the first word points
to an array of 8 elements, length is 5 and capacity is 8. It means that I can read
and write to the first 5 elements and I have 3 elements of capacity that I can
leverage later.

![27](../diagrams/27.jpg)

```go
slice2 := make([]string, 5, 8)
slice2[0] = "Apple"
slice2[1] = "Orange"
slice2[2] = "Banana"
slice2[3] = "Grape"
slice2[4] = "Plum"
```

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Length vs Capacity\n")
inspectSlice(slice2)
```

```go
// inspectSlice exposes the slice header for review.
// Parameter: again, there is no value in side the []string so we want a slice.
// Range over a slice, just like we did with array.
// While len tells us the length, cap tells us the capacity
// In the output, we can see the addresses are aligning as expected.
func inspectSlice(slice []string) {
    fmt.Printf("Length[%d] Capacity[%d]\n", len(slice), cap(slice))
    for i := range slice {
        fmt.Printf("[%d] %p %s\n", i, &slice[i], slice[i])
    }
}
```

```
=> Length vs Capacity
Length[5] Capacity[8]
[0] 0xc00007e000 Apple
[1] 0xc00007e010 Orange
[2] 0xc00007e020 Banana
[3] 0xc00007e030 Grape
[4] 0xc00007e040 Plum
```

##### Idea of appending: making slice a dynamic data structure

Declare a nil slice of strings, set to its zero value. 3 word data structure:

first one points to nil, second and last are zero.

```go
var data []string
```

What if I do data := string{}? Is it the same?

No, because data in this case is not set to its zero value. This is why we always
use var for zero value because not every type when we create an empty literal we
have its zero value in return. What actually happens here is that we have a slice
but it has a pointer (as opposed to nil). This is considered an empty slice, not a
nil slice. There is a semantic between a nil slice and an empty slice. Any
reference type that is set to its zero value can be considered nil. If we pass a
nil slice to a marshal function, we get back a string that says null but when we
pass an empty slice, we get an empty JSON document. But where does that pointer
point to? It is an empty struct, which we will review later.

Capture the capacity of the slice.

```go
    lastCap := cap(data)
```

Append ~100k strings to the slice.

```go
    for record := 1;record <= 102400;record++ {
```

Use the built-in function append to add to the slice. It allows us to add value to
a slice, making the data structure dynamic, yet still allows us to use that
contiguous block of memory that gives us the predictable access pattern from
mechanical sympathy. The append call is working with value semantic. We are not
sharing this slice but appending to it and returning a new copy of it. The slice
gets to stay on the stack, not heap.

```go
    data = append(data, fmt.Sprintf("Rec: %d", record))
```

Every time append runs, it checks the length and capacity. If it is the same, it
means that we have no room. append creates a new backing array, double its size,
copy the old value back in and append the new value. It mutates its copy on its
stack frame and returns us a copy. We replace our slice with the new copy. If it
is not the same, it means that we have extra elements of capacity we can use. Now
we can bring these extra capacities into the length and no copy is being made.
This is very efficient. Looking at the last column in the output, when the backing
array is 1000 elements or less, it doubles the size of the backing array for
growth. Once we pass 1000 elements, the growth rate moves to 25%. When the
capacity of the slice changes, display the changes.

```go
    if lastCap != cap(data) {
```

Calculate the percent of change.

```go
    capChg := float64(cap(data)-lastCap) / float64(lastCap) * 100 
```

Save the new values for capacity.

```go
    lastCap = cap(data)
```

Display the results.

```go
    fmt.Printf("Addr[%p]\tIndex[%d]\t\tCap[%d - %2.f%%]\n", &data[0], record, cap(data), capChg)
```

```

```

##### Slice of slice

Take a slice of slice2. We want just indexes 2 and 3. The length is slice3 is 2
and capacity is 6.

Parameters are [starting_index:(starting_index + length)]

By looking at the output, we can see that they are sharing the same backing array.
These slice headers get to stay on the stack when we use these value semantics.
Only the backing array that needed to be on the heap.

```go
slice3 := slice2[2:4]
```

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Slice of slice (before)\n")
inspectSlice(slice2)
inspectSlice(slice3)
```

When we change the value of the index 0 of slice3, who are going to see this
change?

```
=> Slice of slice (before)
Length[5] Capacity[8]
[0] 0xc00007e000 Apple
[1] 0xc00007e010 Orange
[2] 0xc00007e020 Banana
[3] 0xc00007e030 Grape
[4] 0xc00007e040 Plum
Length[2] Capacity[6]
[0] 0xc00007e020 Banana
[1] 0xc00007e030 Grape
```

```go
slice3[0] = "CHANGED"
```

The answer is both. We have to always be aware that we are modifying an existing
slice. We have to be aware who is using it, who is sharing that backing array.

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Slice of slice (after)\n")
inspectSlice(slice2)
inspectSlice(slice3)
```

```
=> Slice of slice (after)
Length[5] Capacity[8]
[0] 0xc00007e000 Apple
[1] 0xc00007e010 Orange
[2] 0xc00007e020 CHANGED
[3] 0xc00007e030 Grape
[4] 0xc00007e040 Plum
Length[2] Capacity[6]
[0] 0xc00007e020 CHANGED
[1] 0xc00007e030 Grape
```

How about slice3 := append(slice3, "CHANGED")? Similar problem will occur with
append if the length and capacity is not the same. Instead of changing slice3 at
index 0, we call append on slice3. Since the length of slice3 is 2, capacity is 6
at the moment, we have extra rooms for modification. We go and change the element
at index 3 of slice3, which is index 4 of slice2. That is very dangerous. So, what
if the length and capacity is the same? Instead of making slice3 capacity 6, we
set it to 2 by adding another parameter to the slicing syntax like this: slice3
:= slice2[2:4:4]

When append looks at this slice and sees that the length and capacity is the same,
it wouldn't bring in the element at index 4 of slice2. It would detach. slice3
will have a length of 2 and capacity of 2, still share the same backing array. On
the call to append, length and capacity will be different. The addresses are also
different. This is called a 3 index slice. This new slice will get its own backing
array and we don't affect anything at all to our original slice.

##### Copy a slice

copy only works with string and slice only. Make a new slice big enough to hold
elements of the original slice and copy the values over using the built-in copy
function.

```go
slice4 := make([]string, len(slice2))
copy(slice4, slice2)

fmt.Printf("\n=> Copy a slice\n")
inspectSlice(slice4)
```

```
=> Copy a slice
Length[5] Capacity[5]
[0] 0xc00005c050 Apple
[1] 0xc00005c060 Orange
[2] 0xc00005c070 CHANGED
[3] 0xc00005c080 Grape
[4] 0xc00005c090 Plum
```

##### Slice and reference

Declare a slice of integers with 7 values.

```go
x := make([]int, 7)
```

Random starting counters.

```go
for i := 0; i < 7; i++ {
    x[i] = i * 100
}
```

Set a pointer to the second element of the slice.

```go
twohundred := &x[1]
```

Append a new value to the slice. This line of code raises a red flag. We have x is
a slice with length 7, capacity 7. Since the length and capacity is the same,
append doubles its size then copy values over. x nows points to different memory
block and has a length of 8, capacity of 14.

```go
x = append(x, 800)
```

When we change the value of the second element of the slice, twohundred is not
gonna change because it points to the old slice. Everytime we read it, we will get
the wrong value.

```go
x[1]++
```

By printing out the output, we can see that we are in trouble.

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Slice and reference\n")
fmt.Println("twohundred:", *twohundred, "x[1]:", x[1])
```

```
=> Slice and reference
twohundred: 100 x[1]: 101
```

##### UTF-8

Everything in Go is based on UTF-8 character sets. If we use different encoding
scheme, we might have a problem.

Declare a string with both Chinese and English characters. For each Chinese
character, we need 3 byte for each one. The UTF-8 is built on 3 layers: bytes,
code point and character. From Go perspective, string are just bytes. That is what
we are storing.

In our example, the first 3 bytes represents a single code point that represents
that single character. We can have anywhere from 1 to 4 bytes representing a code
point (a code point is a 32 bit value) and anywhere from 1 to multiple code points
can actually represent a character. To keep it simple, we only have 3 bytes
representing 1 code point representing 1 character. So we can read s as 3 bytes, 3
bytes, 1 byte, 1 byte,... (since there are only 2 Chinese characters in the first
place, the rest are English)

```go
s := "世界 means world"
```

UTFMax is 4 -- up to 4 bytes per encoded rune -> maximum number of bytes we need
to represent any code point is 4. mRune is its own type. It is an alias for int32
type. Similar to type byte we are using, it is just an alias for uint8.

```go
var buf [utf8.UTFMax]byte
```

When we are ranging over a string, are we doing it byte by byte or code point by
code point or character by character? The answer is code point by code point.
On the first iteration, i is 0. On the next one, i is 3 because we are moving to
the next code point. Then i is 6.

```go
for i, r := range s {
```

Capture the number of bytes for this rune/code point.

```go
    rl := utf8.RuneLen(r)
```

Calculate the slice offset for the bytes associated with this rune.

```go
    si := i + rl
```

Copy rune from the string to our buffer. We want to go through every code point
and copy them into our array buf, and display them on the screen.
"Every array is just a slice waiting to happen." - Go saying
We are using the slicing syntax, creating our slice header where buf becomes the
backing array. All of them are on the stack. There is no allocation here.

```go
    copy(buf[:], s[i:si])
```

Display the details.

```go
    fmt.Printf("%2d: %q; codepoint: %#6x; encoded bytes: %#v\n"​, i, r, r, buf[:rl])
```

```
0: '世'; codepoint: 0x4e16; encoded bytes: []byte{0xe4, 0xb8, 0x96}
3: '界'; codepoint: 0x754c; encoded bytes: []byte{0xe7, 0x95, 0x8c}
6: ' '; codepoint: 0x20; encoded bytes: []byte{0x20}

#### Map

user defines a user in the program.

```go
type user struct {
    name string
    username string
}
```

##### Declare and initialize

Declare and make a map that stores values of type user with a key of type string.

```go
func main() {
    users1 := make(map[string]user)

    // Add key/value pairs to the map
    users1["Roy"] = user{"Rob", "Roy"}
    users1["Ford"] = user{"Henry", "Ford"}
    users1["Mouse"] = user{"Mickey", "Mouse"}
    users1["Jackson"] = user{"Michael", "Jackson"}

    // Iterate over map
    fmt.Printf("\n=> Iterate over map\n")
    for key, value := range users1 {
            fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```

```
=> Iterate over map
Roy {Rob Roy}
Ford {Henry Ford}
Mouse {Mickey Mouse}
Jackson {Michael Jackson}
```

##### Map literals

Declare and initialize the map with values.

```go
users2 := map[string]user{
    "Roy": {"Rob", "Roy"},
    "Ford": {"Henry", "Ford"},
    "Mouse": {"Mickey", "Mouse"},
    "Jackson": {"Michael", "Jackson"},
}
```

```go
// Iterate over the map.
fmt.Printf("\n=> Map literals\n")
for key, value := range users2 {
    fmt.Println(key, value)
}
```

```
=> Map literals
Roy {Rob Roy}
Ford {Henry Ford}
Mouse {Mickey Mouse}
Jackson {Michael Jackson}
```

##### Delete key

```go
delete(users2, "Roy")
```

##### Find key

Find the Roy key. If found is True, we will get a copy value of that type. if
found is False, u is still a value of type user but is set to its zero value.

```go
u1, found1 := users2["Roy"]
u2, found2 := users2["Ford"]
```

Display the value and found flag.

```go
fmt.Printf("\n=> Find key\n")
fmt.Println("Roy", found1, u1)
fmt.Println("Ford", found2, u2)
```

```
=> Find key
Roy false { }
Ford true {Henry Ford}
```

##### Map key restrictions

```go
type users []user
```

Using this syntax, we can define a set of users This is a second way we can define
users. We can use an existing type and use it as a base for another type. These
are two different types. There is no relationship here. However, when we try use
it as a key, like: u := make(map[users]int) the compiler says we cannot use that:
"invalid map key type users"

The reason is: whatever we use for the key, the value must be comparable. We have
to use it in some sort of boolean expression in order for the map to create a hash
value for it.
