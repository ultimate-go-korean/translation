#### Decoupling

##### Struct Composition 


Prototyping is important, as well as writing proof of concept and solving problems in the concrete first. Then we can ask ourselves: What can change? What change is coming? so we can start decoupling and refactor. Refactoring needs to become a part of the development cycle.

Here is the problem that we are trying to solve in this section. We have a system called Xenia that has a database. There is another system called Pillar, which is a web server with some front-end that consumes it. It has a database too. Our goal is to move Xenia's data into Pillar's system.

How long is it gonna take? How do we know when a piece of code is done so we can move on the next piece of code? If you are a technical manager, how do you know whether your debt is "wasting effort" or "not putting enough effort"?

To answer, being done has 2 parts. One is test coverage, 80% in general and 100% on the happy path. Second is about changes. By asking what can change, from a technical perspective and business perspective, we make sure that we refactor the code to be able to handle that change.

One example is, we can give you a concrete version in 2 days but we need 2 weeks to be able to refactor this code to deal with the change that we know it's coming. The plan is to solve one problem at a time. Don't be overwhelmed by everything. Write a little code, write some tests and refactor. Write a layer of APIs that work on top of each other, knowing that each layer is a strong foundation to the next.

Do not pay too much attention to the implementation detail. It's the mechanics here that are important. We are optimizing for correctness, not performance. We can always go back if it doesn't perform well enough to speed things up.

```go
package main

import ( 
	"errors"
	"fmt" 
	"io"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)
```

The first problem that we have to solve is that we need software that runs on a timer. It needs to connect to Xenia, read that database, identify all the data we haven't moved and pull it in.

```go
func init() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
}
```

Data is the structure of the data we are copying. For simplicity, just pretend it is a string data.

```go
type Data struct { 
	Line string
}
```

Xenia is a system we need to pull data from.

```go
type Xenia struct { 
	Host string
	Timeout time.Duration 
}
```

Pull knows how to pull data out of Xenia. We could do func (*Xenia) Pull() (*Data, error) that return the data and error. However, this would cost an allocation on every call and we don't want that. Using the function below, we know data is a struct type and its size ahead of time. Therefore they could be on the stack.

```go
func (*Xenia) Pull(d *Data) error { 
    switch rand.Intn(10) {
    case 1, 9:
        return io.EOF
    case 5:
        return errors.New("Error reading data from Xenia")
    default:
    d.Line = "Data"
    fmt.Println("In:", d.Line) 
    return nil
    }
}
```

Pillar is a system we need to store data into.

```go
type Pillar struct { 
    Host string
    Timeout time.Duration 
}
```

Store knows how to store data into Pillar. We are using pointer semantics for consistency.

```go
func (*Pillar) Store(d *Data) error { 
    fmt.Println("Out:", d.Line) 
    return nil
}
```

System wraps Xenia and Pillar together into a single system. We have the API based on Xenia and Pillar. We want to build another API on top of this and use it as a foundation. One way is to have a type that has the behavior of being able to pull and store. We can do that through composition. System is based on the embedded value of Xenia and Pillar. And because of inner type promotion, System knows how to pull and store.

```go
type System struct { 
    Xenia
    Pillar 
}
```

pull knows how to pull bulks of data from Xenia, leveraging the foundation that we have built.

We don't need to add a method to System to do this. There is no state inside System that we want the System to maintain. Instead, we want the System to understand the behavior.

Functions are a great way of writing API because functions can be more readable than any method can. We always want to start with an idea of writing API from the package level with functions.

When we write a function, all the input must be passed in. When we use a method, its signature doesn't indicate any level, what field or state that we are using on that value that we use to make the call.

```go
func pull(x *Xenia, data []Data) (int, error) {
```

Range over the slice of data and share each element with the Xenial's Pull method.

```go
    for i := range data {
        if err := x.Pull(&data[i]); err != nil {
            return i, err 
        }
    }
    
    return len(data), nil 
}
```

store knows how to store bulks of data into Pillar. Similar to the function above. We might wonder if it is efficient. However, we are optimizing for correctness, not performance. When it is done, we will test it. If it is not fast enough, we will add more complexities to make it run faster.

```go
func store(p *Pillar, data []Data) (int, error) { 
    for i := range data {
        if err := p.Store(&data[i]); err != nil { 
            return i, err
        } 
    }

    return len(data), nil 
}
```

Copy knows how to pull and store data from the System. Now we can call the pull and store functions, passing Xenia and Pillar through.

```go
func Copy(sys *System, batch int) error { 
    data := make([]Data, batch)

    for {
        i, err := pull(&sys.Xenia, data) 
        if i > 0 {
            if _, err := store(&sys.Pillar, data[:i]); err != nil {
                return err
            } 
        }

        if err != nil { 
            return err
        } 
    }
}
```

```go
func main() {
    sys := System {
        Xenia: Xenia {
            Host: "localhost:8000", 
            Timeout: time.Second,
        },
        Pillar: Pillar {
            Host: "localhost:9000",
            Timeout: time.Second, 
        },
    }

    if err := Copy(&sys, 3); err != io.EOF { 
        fmt.Println(err)
    } 
}
```

##### Decoupling With Interface

By looking at the API (functions), we need to decouple the API from the concrete

implementation. The decoupling that we do must get all the way down into initialization. To do this right, the only piece of code that we need to change is initialization. Everything else should be able to act on the behavior that these types are gonna provide.

pull is based on the concrete. It only knows how to work on Xenia. However, if we are able to decouple pull to use any system that knows how to pull data, we can get the highest level of decoupling. Since the algorithm we have is already efficient, we don't need to add another level of generalization and destroy the work we did in the concrete. Same thing with store.

It is nice to work from the concrete up. When we do this, not only are we solving problems efficiently and reducing technical debt but the contracts, they come to us. We already know what the contract is for pulling/storing data. We already validate that and this is what we need.

Let's just decouple these 2 functions and add 2 interfaces. The Puller interface knows how to pull and the Storer knows how to store.

Xenia already implemented the Puller interface and Pillar already implemented the Storer interface. Now we can come into pull/store, decouple this function from the concrete.

Instead of passing Xenial and Pillar, we pass in the Puller and Storer. The algorithm doesn't change. All we are doing now is calling pull/store indirectly through the interface value.

```go
package main
import ( "errors"
"fmt"
"io" "math/rand" "time"
)
func init() { rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
}
```

Data is the structure of the data we are copying.

```go
 type Data struct { Line string
}
```

Puller declares behavior for pulling data.

```go
type Puller interface { Pull(d *Data) error
}
```

Storer declares behavior for storing data.

```go
type Storer interface { Store(d *Data) error
}
```

Xenia is a system we need to pull data from.

```go
type Xenia struct { Host string
Timeout time.Duration }
```

Pull knows how to pull data out of Xenia.

```go
func (*Xenia) Pull(d *Data) error { switch rand.Intn(10) {
case 1, 9:
return io.EOF
case 5:
return errors.New("Error reading data from Xenia")
default:
d.Line = "Data"
fmt.Println("In:", d.Line)
return nil }
}
```

Pillar is a system we need to store data into.

```go
 type Pillar struct { Host string
 Timeout time.Duration }
```

Store knows how to store data into Pillar.

```go
func (*Pillar) Store(d *Data) error { fmt.Println("Out:", d.Line) return nil
}
```

System wraps Xenia and Pillar together into a single system.

```go
type System struct { Xenia
Pillar }
```

pull knows how to pull bulks of data from any Puller.

```go
func pull(p Puller, data []Data) (int, error) { for i := range data {
if err := p.Pull(&data[i]); err != nil { return i, err
} }
return len(data), nil }
```

store knows how to store bulks of data from any Storer.

```go
func store(s Storer, data []Data) (int, error) { for i := range data {
if err := s.Store(&data[i]); err != nil { return i, err
} }
return len(data), nil }
```

Copy knows how to pull and store data from the System.

```go
func Copy(sys *System, batch int) error { data := make([]Data, batch)
for {
i, err := pull(&sys.Xenia, data) if i > 0 {
{
}
if _, err := store(&sys.Pillar, data[:i]); err != nil return err
} }
if err != nil { return err
```

```go
func main() {
sys := System{
Xenia: Xenia{
Host: "localhost:8000", Timeout: time.Second,
            },
            Pillar: Pillar{
Host: "localhost:9000",
Timeout: time.Second, },
}
if err := Copy(&sys, 3); err != io.EOF { fmt.Println(err)
} }
```

##### Interface Composition 79


Let's just add another interface. Let's use interface composition to do this. PullStorer has both behaviors: Puller and Storer. Any concrete type that implements both pull and store is a PullStorer. System is a PullStorer because it is embedded in these 2 types, Xenia and Pillar. Now we just need to go into Copy, replace the system pointer with PullStorer and no other code needs to change.

Looking closely at Copy, there is something that could potentially confuse us. We are passing the PullStorer interface value directly into pull and store respectively.

If we look into pull and store, they don't want a PullStorer. One wants a Puller and one wants a Storer. Why does the compiler allow us to pass a value of different type value while it didn't allow us to do that before?

This is because Go has what is called: implicit interface conversion. This is possible because:
  - Allinterfacevalueshavetheexactsamemodel(implementationdetails).
  - Ifthetypeinformationisclear,theconcretetypethatexistsinone
    interface has enough behaviors for another interface. It is true that any concrete type that is stored inside of a PullStorer must also implement the Storer and Puller.
    
Let's further look into the code.

In the main function, we are creating a value of our System type. As we know, our System type value is based on the embedding of two concrete types: Xenia and Pillar, where Xenia knows how to pull and Pillar knows how to store. Because of inner type promotion, System knows how to pull and store both inherently. We are passing the address of our System to Copy. Copy then creates the PullStorer interface. The first word is a System pointer and the second word points to the original value. This interface now knows how to pull and store. When we call pull off of ps, we call pull off of System, which eventually call pull off of Xenia.

Here is the kicker: the implicit interface conversion.

We can pass the interface value ps to pull because the compiler knows that any concrete type stored inside the PullStorer must also implement Puller. We end up with another interface called Puller. Because the memory models are the same for all interfaces, we just copy those 2 words so they are all sharing the same interface type. Now when we call pull off of Puller, we call pull off of System.

Similar to Storer.

All using value semantic for the interface value and pointer semantic to share.

##### Decoupling With Interface Composition 84

We change our concrete type System. Instead of using two concrete types Xenia and Pillar, we use 2 interface types Puller and Storer. Our concrete type System where we can have concrete behaviors is now based on the embedding of 2 interface types. It means that we can inject any data, not based on the common DNA but on the data that provides the capability, the behavior that we need.

Now our code can be fully decoupled because any value that implements the Puller interface can be stored inside the System (same with Storer interface). We can create multiple Systems and that data can be passed in Copy.

We don't need a method here. We just need one function that accepts data and its behavior will change based on the data we put in.

Now System is not based on Xenia and Pillar anymore. It is based on 2 interfaces, one that stores Xenia and one that stores Pillar. We get the extra layer of decoupling.

If the system changes, no big deal. We replace the system as we need to during the program startup.

We solve this problem. We put this in production. Every single refactoring that we did went into production before we did the next one. We keep minimizing technical debt.
